The sun is shining, the breeze feels good against the skin. Which one is our ship?  Is it the Xebec, a masterful balance of speed and strength? Popular for a cargo mission such as ours?';

An excellent navigator is he, and swiftly gets to the destination. [SM: Good day Captain]  And here is Flockhart, our Boatswain, in charge of maintenance and supplies. He knows a ship from bottom to top, and he meets the challenges of any voyage. [B: Looking foward to embarkation, Sir.]  And this is our Master Gunner, Bramley. He'll be invaluable should we run into pirate trouble. [MG: An honor, captain.] A fine crew if ever I saw one. We have a bit of extra time, would you like to talk to one of your crew a bit more?';

But anyway, rest assured, you can always ask me the ship's goings on. I've got my ear to the deck. You can ask for the Ship Status, or the Crew Status, and I'll tell you all.
