This project, working title "Deadbots Tell No Tales", is an audio avdenture game Alexa skill developed in 23 hours during the 2017 GGJ at the playcrafting/microsoft NYC location. DTNT is played using only speech, by conversing with an Amazon Echo or Echo Dot.

Because an Alexa skill cannot be approved to go live with Amazon in a short time frame, the format is not conducive to a game jam. However, visitors can still try DTNT by following the instructions in the install.md file in the repo.

Once you deploy the skill, to activate it say "load dead bots". After playing, say "exit" to end the session and clear your save.

The theme of GGJ 2017 is "Waves." We were thinking of making an Alexa skill game before the theme was announced, and when we heard the theme it was decided - we would definitely make a game that is controlled by soundwaves. We went with a seafaring adventure theme to take it home.
